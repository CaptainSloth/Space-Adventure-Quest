# Space Adventure Quest — Plan.md

**A BBS-style multiplayer space odyssey door game**
*Inspired by TradeWars / Planets: TEOS · Built on LoAF architecture patterns*

---

## Vision

Space Adventure Quest (SAQ) is a persistent multiplayer BBS door game where players pilot ships through a galaxy of sectors, colonize planets, trade commodities, form Companies (teams), wage war, negotiate alliances, and shape the galaxy itself. Players choose to be **Alliance**, **Empire**, or **Neutral** — and the galaxy shifts around them.

The game runs in Electron + React with a monospace BBS aesthetic. Multiple players connect via separate nodes (Electron windows or network clients), and the game world is shared in real-time via a central SQLite database with change-notification IPC.

**The #1 goal: Actually fun to play.**

Each Node:
  Renderer (React) ←→ Preload IPC ←→ Engine Instance
```

### Key Architecture Decisions

1. **One engine instance per connected player** — each player has their own engine state, but all read/write the same SQLite DB
2. **DB is the source of truth** — player positions, planet ownership, inventory, combat logs all live in SQLite
3. **Event bus for real-time** — when Player A attacks Player B, an event row is inserted; Player B's engine polls for events and surfaces them
4. **Scenes remain pure functions** — same pattern as LoAF: `(state, repo, content) => ViewModel`
5. **Async IPC for multiplayer events** — unlike LoAF's fully synchronous IPC, SAQ adds async channels for push notifications (incoming attacks, messages, trade offers)

---

## 3. Multiplayer & Multinode

### Node Model

Each "node" is an Electron BrowserWindow (local) or a connected TCP client (future). Every node runs its own engine instance scoped to one logged-in player.

```
Node = {
  playerId: string;
  engine: EngineInstance;
  window: BrowserWindow;   // or TCP socket
}
```

### Real-Time Interactions

Some game features only appear when 2+ players are online simultaneously:

| Feature | Requirement | How It Works |
|---------|-------------|--------------|
| Sector chat | 2+ in same sector | Messages stored in DB `sector_messages` table, polled by engines |
| Real-time PvP | 2+ in same sector | Attacker inserts combat event; defender's engine picks it up |
| Trade offers | 2+ online | Offer row in DB; recipient sees it on next poll |
| Company comms | 2+ company members online | Company message channel |
| Multinode events | 2+ online anywhere | Special random events, galaxy-wide announcements |
| Blockade running | 2+ (attacker + traveler) | Player sets blockade on sector; others must fight or flee |

### Presence Detection

```sql
-- Engine heartbeat: each node updates every 5 seconds
UPDATE players SET lastSeen = datetime('now') WHERE id = ?;

-- "Online" = lastSeen within 15 seconds
SELECT * FROM players WHERE lastSeen > datetime('now', '-15 seconds');
```

### Event Queue

```sql
CREATE TABLE events (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  targetPlayerId TEXT NOT NULL,
  type TEXT NOT NULL,          -- 'attack', 'message', 'trade_offer', 'alert', etc.
  payload TEXT NOT NULL,       -- JSON
  createdAt TEXT NOT NULL,
  readAt TEXT                  -- NULL = unread
);
```

Each engine polls `events` for its player every 2-3 seconds. Unread events trigger UI notifications.

---

## 4. Core Game Loop

### Daily Flow

```
Player logs in
  → See MOTD / daily news / planet reports
  → Check Company status (who's played today)
  → Navigate galaxy (spend turns moving between sectors)
  → At each sector:
      → Trade commodities at ports
      → Land on planets (own or neutral)
      → Encounter NPCs
      → Fight other players or NPC ships
      → Deploy mines / fighters
      → Explore unknown sectors
  → Return to base (Alliance/Empire home planet or personal planet)
  → Play Star Cards (CCG) at cantinas
  → Manage planets (set taxes, build defenses, name it)
  → Log off (turns saved for next day)
```

### Turn System

- Each player gets **N turns per day** (configurable, default 75)
- Moving between sectors costs 1 turn per hop (warp drive reduces this)
- Combat costs 1 turn per round
- Landing on a planet costs 0 turns
- Trading costs 0 turns (but you must spend turns to reach the port)
- Some actions are turn-free (chatting, checking rankings, managing inventory)

---

## 5. Factions & Alignment

### Three Factions

| Faction | Alignment | Color | Home Planet | Description |
|---------|-----------|-------|-------------|-------------|
| **The Alliance** | Good | `%2` (Green) | Terra Prime (Sector 1) | Democratic federation, defensive focus, trade bonuses |
| **The Empire** | Evil | `%1` (Red) | Fortress Krath (Sector 50) | Authoritarian regime, combat bonuses, raid bonuses |
| **Neutral** | Neutral | `%7` (White) | None (nomadic) | Independent traders/pirates, stealth bonuses |

### Alignment Mechanics

- Alignment is a **spectrum** (-1000 to +1000), not a binary choice
- Actions shift alignment:
  - Attacking Alliance players/planets → shifts toward Empire
  - Defending Alliance territory → shifts toward Alliance
  - Trading fairly → slight Alliance shift
  - Raiding planets → shifts toward Empire
  - Helping NPCs → shifts toward Alliance
  - Smuggling / black market → slight Empire shift
- At thresholds: ≥200 = Alliance member, ≤-200 = Empire member, else Neutral
- Faction membership grants access to faction home planet, faction shop, faction missions

### Faction Benefits

| Perk | Alliance | Empire | Neutral |
|------|----------|--------|---------|
| Trade bonus | +10% sell prices | — | +5% buy discount |
| Combat bonus | — | +15% weapon damage | — |
| Stealth | — | — | +20% avoid detection |
| Planet defense | +10% defense | — | — |
| Raid bonus | — | +15% plunder | — |
| Home base | Terra Prime | Fortress Krath | Any owned planet |

## 6. Companies (Teams)

### Structure

```
Company (max 10 players)
  ├── CEO (founder, full permissions)
  ├── Officers (invite/kick, manage treasury)
  └── Members (basic access)

Allied Companies (up to 20 players across alliances)
  └── Mutual defense pacts, shared intel, no friendly fire
```

### Company Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Treasury** | Shared gold pool. CEO/Officers deposit/withdraw. Used for Company ships, planet purchases |
| **Company planets** | Planets owned by the Company, not individual. Revenue split among members |
| **Company fleet** | Shared ships that any member can pilot |
| **Company chat** | Private message channel |
| **Activity tracker** | See which members have played today and how many turns used |
| **Alliance pacts** | Form alliances with other Companies. Allied players can't attack each other |
| **Company missions** | Special missions requiring multiple members to complete |
| **Company rankings** | Ranked by total assets, kills, planets, trade volume |

### Company Database

```sql
CREATE TABLE companies (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  ceoPlayerId TEXT NOT NULL,
  faction TEXT,                    -- 'alliance', 'empire', 'neutral', or NULL (mixed)
  treasury INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  createdAt TEXT NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE company_members (
  companyId TEXT NOT NULL,
  playerId TEXT NOT NULL,
  role TEXT DEFAULT 'member',      -- 'ceo', 'officer', 'member'
  joinedAt TEXT NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (companyId, playerId)
);

CREATE TABLE company_alliances (
  companyA TEXT NOT NULL,
  companyB TEXT NOT NULL,
  formedAt TEXT NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (companyA, companyB)
);
```

## 7. The Galaxy — Sectors & Navigation

### Galaxy Structure

The galaxy is a **graph of sectors** connected by warps. Default galaxy: 500 sectors (configurable 100–5000).

```
Sector = {
  id: number;                    // 1–500
  name?: string;                 // optional custom name
  type: SectorType;              // 'normal', 'nebula', 'asteroid_field', 'black_hole', 'station', 'home_alliance', 'home_empire'
  warps: number[];               // connected sector IDs (2–6 connections)
  planets: Planet[];             // 0–5 planets per sector
  port?: Port;                   // trading port (if present)
  hazard?: Hazard;               // environmental hazard
  mines: Mine[];                 // player-deployed mines
  fighters: Fighter[];           // player-deployed fighter drones
}
```

### Navigation

- **Warp drive**: move to an adjacent sector (1 turn per hop)
- **Transwarp**: jump to any explored sector (costs fuel + 1 turn)
- **Autopilot**: set a destination, engine calculates shortest path, auto-move (costs turns)
- **Sector scan**: see what's in adjacent sectors without moving (0 turns)
- **Galaxy map**: ASCII art showing explored sectors and connections

### Sector Types

| Type | Effect |
|------|--------|
| Normal | No special effects |
| Nebula | Sensors reduced, stealth +50%, navigation hazard |
| Asteroid Field | Mining possible, navigation damage risk |
| Black Hole | One-way warp, random destination, high risk/reward |
| Station | Safe zone, trading, repair, cantina |
| Home (Alliance) | Terra Prime, Alliance members only |
| Home (Empire) | Fortress Krath, Empire members only |

### Galaxy Generation

Procedural generation with constraints:
1. Alliance home always Sector 1, Empire home always Sector 500 (or max)
2. Each sector has 2–6 warp connections (graph is fully connected)
3. Ports placed in ~40% of sectors
4. Nebulae, asteroid fields, black holes placed randomly (~15% each)
5. Stations at key crossroads (~5%)

---

## 8. Planets

### Planet Ownership

Any player or Company can claim an unowned planet. Owned planets generate daily income and can be customized.

```
Planet = {
  id: string;
  sectorId: number;
  name: string;                      // customizable by owner
  ownerId?: string;                  // player or company ID
  ownerType?: 'player' | 'company';
  type: PlanetType;                  // 'terran', 'volcanic', 'ice', 'gas_giant', 'desert', 'ocean', 'barren'
  population: number;                // grows daily, generates taxes
  maxPopulation: number;
  credits: number;                   // stored credits from taxes
  fighters: number;                  // defense fighters
  shields: number;                   // 0–100%
  mines: { ore: number, fuel: number, equipment: number };
  buildings: Building[];
  customDescription?: string;        // owner's custom text
  customAscii?: string[];            // owner's custom ASCII art (≤8 lines)
  landingMessage?: string;           // shown to visitors
  taxRate: number;                   // 0–50%
  accessPolicy: 'open' | 'faction' | 'company' | 'locked';
}
```

### Planet Types

| Type | Pop. Cap | Mining | Special |
|------|----------|--------|---------|
| Terran | High | Balanced | Best for colonization |
| Volcanic | Low | Ore ++ | Equipment crafting bonus |
| Ice | Medium | Fuel ++ | Research bonus |
| Gas Giant | None | Fuel +++ | Fuel depot only |
| Desert | Low | Ore + | Cheap to defend |
| Ocean | Medium | None | Food production, pop growth ++ |
| Barren | Very Low | Ore + | Cheap to claim |

### Planet Customization

Owners can:
- Rename the planet
- Set a custom landing message
- Set access policy (open/faction/company/locked)
- Set tax rate (applied to traders using the planet's port)
- Build structures (shipyard, defense grid, sensor array, cantina, etc.)
- Write a custom description
- Set custom ASCII art for the planet display
- Deploy defense fighters and shields

### Daily Planet Reports

Each day, planet owners receive a report:
```
╔══════════════════════════════════════╗
║  DAILY REPORT — New Tortuga         ║
╠══════════════════════════════════════╣
║  Population: 12,450 (+320)          ║
║  Tax Revenue: 1,245 credits         ║
║  Mining Output: 50 ore, 30 fuel     ║
║  Visitors: 3 (TradeMaster, Zyx...)  ║
║  Attacks: 0                         ║
║  News: A trade fleet arrived from   ║
║        Sector 12.                   ║
╚══════════════════════════════════════╝
```

## 9. Ships

### Ship System

Ships are the player's primary asset. There are **thousands of ship types** organized into tiers/classes.

### Ship Classes (Tiers)

| Tier | Class | Example Ships | Holds | Shields | Weapons | Speed |
|------|-------|--------------|-------|---------|---------|-------|
| 1 | Scout | Wasp, Dart, Probe | 5–15 | 10–30 | 1–2 | Fast |
| 2 | Trader | Hauler, Freighter, Merchantman | 30–75 | 20–50 | 1–3 | Medium |
| 3 | Frigate | Falcon, Corsair, Interceptor | 15–30 | 50–100 | 3–5 | Fast |
| 4 | Cruiser | Warhawk, Battlecruiser, Dreadnought | 20–50 | 100–250 | 5–8 | Medium |
| 5 | Capital | Titan, Leviathan, Fortress | 50–200 | 200–500 | 8–15 | Slow |
| 6 | Legendary | Planet Killer, Ghost Ship, Ark | Special | Special | Special | Varies |

### Ship Definition

```typescript
type ShipDef = {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  class: ShipClass;
  tier: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6;
  holds: number;              // cargo capacity
  maxShields: number;
  maxFighters: number;        // fighter bay capacity
  weaponSlots: number;
  speed: number;              // sectors per turn with warp drive
  fuelCapacity: number;
  transwarp: boolean;         // can transwarp jump?
  cloak: boolean;             // has cloaking device?
  specialAbility?: string;    // unique per-ship ability
  cost: number;
  factionReq?: 'alliance' | 'empire' | 'neutral';
  description: string;
  ascii: string[];            // 5-line ASCII art
};
```

### Generating Thousands of Ships

Ships are defined by a **generation system** that combines:
1. **Base templates** (50–100 hand-crafted archetypes in JSON)
2. **Modifiers** (prefix/suffix system): "Reinforced Scout", "Stealth Frigate", "Heavy Warhawk Mk.III"
3. **Stat variation**: each modifier adjusts base stats (±10–30%)
4. **Procedural naming**: combine prefixes, roots, and suffixes

This means 100 base templates × 10+ modifiers × 3 variants = **3,000+ unique ship configurations**, but each is deterministic and reproducible from its ID.

```typescript
// Example generation
const base = shipTemplates.find(t => t.id === "scout_wasp");
const modifier = modifiers.find(m => m.id === "reinforced");
const result = applyModifier(base, modifier);
// → "Reinforced Wasp": holds=8 (was 5), shields=45 (was 30), cost=+40%
```

### Ship Upgrades

Players can upgrade individual components:
- **Weapons**: Laser → Plasma → Disruptor → Quantum
- **Shields**: Basic → Reinforced → Adaptive → Phase
- **Engine**: Standard → Enhanced → Warp → Transwarp
- **Special**: Cloak, Scanner, Mine Layer, Tractor Beam

---

## 10. NPCs

### Smart NPC System

NPCs are persistent characters with memory, personality, and dynamic behavior.

```typescript
type NpcDef = {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  title?: string;                    // "the Merchant", "Admiral of Sector 7"
  faction: 'alliance' | 'empire' | 'neutral';
  personality: {
    friendliness: number;            // -100 to 100
    greed: number;                   // 0 to 100
    aggression: number;              // 0 to 100
    humor: number;                   // 0 to 100
  };
  likes: string[];                   // "traders", "alliance_members", "brave_pilots"
  dislikes: string[];                // "pirates", "empire_members", "cowards"
  dialogueTree: DialogueNode[];      // custom dialogue options
  shipId?: string;                   // NPC's ship (for combat NPCs)
  sectorId?: number;                 // where they hang out
  scheduleType: 'stationary' | 'patrol' | 'wanderer';
  ascii: string[];                   // portrait
  description: string;
};
```

### NPC Memory

NPCs remember every encounter with every player:

```sql
CREATE TABLE npc_memories (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  npcId TEXT NOT NULL,
  playerId TEXT NOT NULL,
  encounterType TEXT NOT NULL,      -- 'trade', 'combat', 'dialogue', 'quest', 'betrayal'
  sentiment INTEGER NOT NULL,       -- -100 to +100 shift
  details TEXT,                     -- JSON: what happened
  createdAt TEXT NOT NULL
);
```

**How memory affects behavior:**
- NPC who remembers you helping them → better prices, unique quests, tips
- NPC who remembers you attacking them → hostile, refuses trade, may ambush
- NPC who remembers multiple encounters → references past events in dialogue
- Sentiment accumulates: each encounter shifts the NPC's opinion of that specific player

### NPC Dialogue Example

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Captain Vex — The Smuggler         │
│  ╭──────────╮                       │

## 11. Combat

### Ship-to-Ship Combat

```
Combat Flow:
  1. Encounter (random, PvP, blockade, NPC)
  2. Pre-combat: scan opponent (see ship class, shields, faction)
  3. Choose: Fight / Flee / Hail / Surrender
  4. If fight:
     a. Both sides roll initiative (speed + RNG)
     b. Attacker fires weapons → damage = (weaponPower - targetShields%) + RNG
     c. Defender retaliates
     d. Repeat until one side is destroyed, flees, or surrenders
  5. Post-combat:
     - Victor loots cargo, credits, possible ship capture
     - Loser respawns at home base with starter ship (or is rescued by company)
     - Alignment shifts based on who attacked whom
```

### Combat Modifiers

| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Ship speed | Determines initiative and flee chance |
| Cloaking | First-strike advantage, opponent can't scan |
| Fighters | Deployed as autonomous damage dealers |
| Mines | Triggered on sector entry, damage before combat starts |
| Nebula | All accuracy reduced 30% |
| Asteroid field | Random hull damage each round |
| Company backup | Allied players in sector can join the fight |

### PvP Rules

- Players cannot attack members of their own Company or allied Companies
- Attacking a player in a safe zone (station, home planet) is forbidden
- Attacking a much weaker player (3+ tiers below your ship) gives minimal rewards and heavy alignment penalty
- Players can set a "flee threshold" (auto-flee at X% shields)

## 12. Trading & Economy

### Commodities

| Commodity | Common Sources | High Demand At |
|-----------|---------------|----------------|
| Ore | Asteroid fields, volcanic planets | Stations, terran planets |
| Fuel | Gas giants, ice planets | Everywhere (ship fuel) |
| Equipment | Stations, terran planets | Frontier sectors |
| Organics | Ocean planets, terran planets | Desert/barren planets |
| Luxury Goods | Stations | Remote sectors (high markup) |
| Contraband | Black market, pirate NPCs | Anywhere (risky, high profit) |

### Port Trading

```
Port Types:
  Type 1 (BBS): Buys Ore, Sells Equipment
  Type 2 (BSB): Buys Equipment, Sells Ore
  Type 3 (SBB): Sells Ore, Sells Equipment, Buys Fuel
  Type 4 (BBB): Buys everything (consumer world)
  Type 5 (SSS): Sells everything (producer world)
  Type 6 (Special): Black market, rare goods
  Type 7 (SSB): Sells Ore, Sells Equipment, Buys Organics
  Type 8 (BBS): Buys Organics, Buys Fuel, Sells Luxury
```

### Price Mechanics

- Prices fluctuate based on supply/demand per port
- Buying from a port reduces its stock → price goes up
- Selling to a port increases its stock → price goes down
- Prices reset partially each day
- Players with Trade skill (Alliance bonus) get better prices
- Contraband trading: high profit but if scanned by Alliance patrols → combat + alignment penalty

### Trade Routes

Smart players find profitable loops: buy low at Port A, sell high at Port B, repeat. The game tracks "trade route efficiency" for rankings.

### Card Acquisition

- Defeat NPCs in card games at cantinas
- Win cards as combat loot (rare)
- Buy from card merchants at stations
- Company reward cards
- Faction-exclusive cards (Alliance/Empire themed)
- Legendary cards from boss NPCs or special quests

### Card Duel Stakes

| Venue | Entry Fee | Reward | Risk |
|-------|-----------|--------|------|
| Station Cantina | Free | Small credits + common card | None |
| Planet Cantina | 50 credits | Good credits + uncommon card | Lose entry fee |
| Underground | 200 credits | Great credits + rare card | Lose entry + a card |
| Championship | 1000 credits | Huge credits + legendary card | Lose entry + 3 cards |

## 15. Sansi Color Codes

BBS-style inline color codes for all text output. Parsed by the renderer into CSS classes.

### Syntax

```
%0  — Black         %8  — Dark Gray
%1  — Red           %9  — Light Red
%2  — Green         %a  — Light Green
%3  — Yellow        %b  — Light Yellow
%4  — Blue          %c  — Light Blue
%5  — Magenta       %d  — Light Magenta
%6  — Cyan          %e  — Light Cyan
%7  — White         %f  — Bright White

`   — Toggle bold
~   — Toggle blink (slow pulse in CSS)
```

### Examples

```
`%2Welcome`%7 to `%eSpace Adventure Quest`%7!
%1WARNING:%7 Shields critical!
`%bYou earned 500 credits!`%7
```

### Renderer Implementation

```typescript
// Parse Sansi codes into React spans with CSS classes
function parseSansi(text: string): JSX.Element[] {
  // Split on %X and ` tokens
  // Map to <span className="sansi-2 sansi-bold">text</span>
}
```

```css
.sansi-0 { color: #000000; }
.sansi-1 { color: #aa0000; }
.sansi-2 { color: #00aa00; }
/* ... etc ... */
.sansi-bold { font-weight: bold; }
.sansi-blink { animation: blink 1.5s ease-in-out infinite; }
```

## 22. Open Questions

1. **Galaxy persistence**: Should the galaxy be regenerated on admin command, or is it permanent once created? (Recommend: permanent, with admin tools to modify individual sectors)

2. **Turn system**: Fixed daily turns (like LoAF) or time-based regeneration (1 turn per 5 minutes)? (Recommend: daily reset, classic BBS style)

3. **Ship loss on death**: Lose your ship entirely (harsh, classic) or lose cargo + credits but keep ship (forgiving)? (Recommend: configurable per-world)

4. **Real-time vs turn-based PvP**: Should PvP combat be real-time (both players present) or asynchronous (attack offline players)? (Recommend: both — real-time if both online, auto-defense if offline)

5. **Maximum company size**: 10 players per company is stated. Is this hard-coded or admin-configurable? (Recommend: admin-configurable)

6. **Galaxy scale**: Default 500 sectors — should this be smaller for small player counts? (Recommend: auto-scale based on player count, minimum 100)

7. **NPC dialogue authoring**: Hand-written dialogue trees or procedural generation? (Recommend: hand-written for key NPCs, templates for generic NPCs)

8. **Card balance**: Port the LoAF card system directly and reskin, or redesign from scratch with 3 rows? (Recommend: extend LoAF system — add third row + new effects, keep core mechanics)
